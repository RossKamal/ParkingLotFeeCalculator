A parking lot is a dedicated area that is intended for parking vehicles. Parking lots are
present in every city and suburban area. Shopping malls, stadiums, airports, train stations,
and similar venues often feature a parking lot with a large capacity. A parking lot can spread
across multiple buildings with multiple floors or can be in a large open area.
● The parking lot will allow different types of vehicles to be parked:
○ Motorcycles/Scooters
○ Cars/SUVs
○ Buses/Trucks
● Each vehicle will occupy a single spot and the spot size will be different for different
vehicles.
